### DRM

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the DRM definition section</b></p></summary>

- Stands for: `Digital Restrictive Measures` or `Digital restrictions management` (GNU definition)
- Does not stand for: `Digital Rights Management`
- Forms: `WideVine` `FairPlay` `Adobe Digital Editions` `Valve Anti-Cheat` `PrimeTime` `EME` `etc.`

Digital software/malware that attempts to take away the ownership rights and prevent the copying of files that the user has received through a digital distribution medium. DRM is constantly cracked, it is wasteful to both the environment (computing resources required to implement it) and talent (billions of dollars and millions of hours of time wasted per year on something that is not necessary, and can be cracked within days)
