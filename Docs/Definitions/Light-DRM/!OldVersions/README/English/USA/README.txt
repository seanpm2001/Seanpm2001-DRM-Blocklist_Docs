### Light DRM

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Light DRM definition section</b></p></summary>

- Stands for: `Light Digital Restrictive Measures`
- Does not stand for: `Light Digital Rights Management`
- Forms: `EME` `DRM`

DRM that tries to prevent users from right clicking/copying a file on a webpage, but isn't as heavy as a DRM scheme like WideVine. This type of DRM typically doesn't have to be asked to be used, and will run from the browser itself (even in Firefox)
