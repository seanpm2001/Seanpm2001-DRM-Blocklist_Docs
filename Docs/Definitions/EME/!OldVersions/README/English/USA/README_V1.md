### EME

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the EME definition section</b></p></summary>

- Stands for: `Encrypted Media Extensions`
- Does not stand for: `Extended Media Encryption`
- Forms: `EME` `DRM`

A type of DRM (light DRM) that was controversially accepted as an Internet standard (due to support from sites like Netflix) but has caused monopolization of Internet software development, and hindered the progress of innovation (as all DRM does) this DRM tries to prevent users from right clicking/copying a file on a webpage, but isn't as heavy as a DRM scheme like WideVine. This type of DRM typically doesn't have to be asked to be used, and will run from the browser itself (even in Firefox)
