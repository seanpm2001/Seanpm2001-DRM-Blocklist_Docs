### How to test for presence of light DRM (EME)

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the testing for presence of light DRM section</b></p></summary>

1. Load the website in Firefox (without DRM installed/enabled)
2. Try right clicking various pieces of media on the page
3. If the save as option is gr√¶yed out or not present, the site likely uses EME
4. Additionally, if there is a yellow popup by Firefox that says "you must enable DRM to access certain parts of this page" (non-verbatim text) then the site uses DRM and should be added to the DRM list as well.
