# Sources

A site cannot be accused of DRM practices without a proper source. This section contains listed entries for links on the blocklist that are backed up by data proving that foul play is involved. Due to the planned complexity of the blocklist, entries are in this format:

- Site name: `www.example.com`
- Path: `/Docs/Sources/E/X/A/M/P/L/E/README.md`

This is done to ease navigation, as GitHub truncates folders once they reach 1,001 files/folders. It can also be tedious to browse a list 1001+ entries long.

At the moment, there aren't sources for every blocklist entry. It will take time, but it needs to be done. This section can backup a claim to validate the inclusion of the entry on the blocklist.

The format isn't completely solid yet. Improvements are welcome.
